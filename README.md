Disk Scheduling Visualizer

This project is a lab assignment for the Operating System course, which demonstrates the working of various Disk Scheduling Algorithms. The main purpose of this project is to help users understand how these algorithms work and compare their performance.

Features

Implementation of multiple Disk Scheduling Algorithms:

FCFS (First Come First Serve)

SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)

SCAN

C-SCAN

LOOK

C-LOOK

Allows users to provide input for the request sequence and initial head position.

Calculates and compares total head movements and seek time for each algorithm.

Provides visualization/step-by-step execution to clearly show how each algorithm works.

Objective

The main objective of this project is to give students a practical understanding of Disk Scheduling in Operating Systems and to make it easier to analyze the differences between various algorithms.
